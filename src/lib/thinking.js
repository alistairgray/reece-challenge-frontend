// THINKING 
// At a foundational level, this is a problem of navigating and interacting with objects.
// The goal will be to initially prove the base requirements via vanilla javascript and
// then make it work in HTML and CSS. 
// The design needs to be a blend between pleasant visuals and function.
// Testing wise, the project will need to be integrated into React via create-react-app, with
// Jest to verify.
// A nice to have would be to have the ability to adjust the payment months
